Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/felipedaniel1910/machine-learning-algorithms.git
cd machine-learning-algorithms
Next, install the required dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed.

Usage
Each algorithm is implemented as a separate module in the algorithms directory. You can explore and run individual algorithms by navigating into their respective directories. Additionally, there is a examples directory containing sample scripts demonstrating the usage of these algorithms on various datasets.

For example, to run the Decision Tree algorithm, you can use the following commands:

bash
Copy code
cd algorithms/decision_tree
python decision_tree.py
Feel free to adapt and integrate these algorithms into your projects. Remember to customize the parameters based on your specific use case.
