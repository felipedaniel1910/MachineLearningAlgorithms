## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/felipedaniel1910/machine-learning-algorithms.git
cd machine-learning-algorithms
```

Next, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python (version 3.6 or higher) installed.

## Usage

Each algorithm is described on the file name, for example, "decision_tree" and the format is "ipynb". These algorithms can be opened with VSCode, Jupyter NOtebook, or even Google Colab.

Feel free to adapt and integrate these algorithms into your projects. Remember to customize the parameters based on your specific use case.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Whether you want to add a new algorithm, improve existing code, or fix bugs, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add feature'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Submit a pull request.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
